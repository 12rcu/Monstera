# Contribute

A small guide to contributing to this repo.

## Adding new features

Before adding large features, start a discussion if such a feature is wanted or maybe already in progress.
For smaller features, just create a PR for the changes.

## Fixing a bug

For minor bugs, create a PR with the changes, if there is a problem with that bug, reference it in the PR.
If there is a major bug that affects a large part of the library (for example, the `Builder.kt`), start a discussion.

## Creating issues

If you found a bug or want a feature added, create an issue. See the issue template!
